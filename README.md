## Overview
One of my very first applications. I wrote this application at the time that I was learning fundamentals of programming. The first programming language I learnt is Python. So I used one of the their desktop application frameworks called as [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to implement this app. 

 I used the file system provided by os as the database for data persistence since I had no idea working with sql or no-sql dbs at that time.
